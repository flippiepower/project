            <h2>Challenges and Frustations faced during the project</h2>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p> The biggest challenge for me during this project was that I didn't wanted to focus on bee hotels but on creating ways for bees to cross highways. But the members of my group wanted to make a bee hotel. I noticed that I found it hard to find the motivation for creating this bee hotel, resulting in me not putting all I got in it. </p>
			
			<p>Next to that I found it difficult to work together in this group. I had the feeling that I needed to do a lot of stimulation to make something from this project and that my teammates had a different focus during the project.  </p>
            <h3>Ways to improve</h3>
            <p> I think I can benefit from a more flexibel view point. Allowing me better to adapt to situation that don't go my way. </p>
			<p>Further I think I should have intervened earlier during the teamwork, this would have saved me a lot frustaion and would have made the project better. </p>
